"classic" => "Bestowed to cocktails with a wide distribution across many great bars. While modern cocktails may sometimes be classic, most drinks on this list will be older.",
"original" => "These recipes were developed in-house to explore exciting ideas or underrepresented flavor combinations.",
"stirred" => "Stirred cocktails are made without a shaker. They may be crafted using a mixing glass and cocktail spoon or a humble pint glass and kitchen spoon. Many stirred cocktails do not contain citrus juice.",
"shaken" => "Shaken cocktails are made using a cocktail shaker. Many shaken cocktails contain citrus juice such as lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit.",
"built in glass" => "The easiest type of cocktail to prepare; this style of recipe is crafted by building all ingredients together in the glass it will be served in.",
"up" => "This style of drink involves shaking or stirring the ingredients over ice before straining the contents into a glass with no ice.",
"rocks" => "This style of drink is presented to the drinker over a handful of medium-sized cubes in a glass. A rocks or collins glass is the most popular way to imbibe this type of drink.",
"large cube" => "Many cocktails taste best over one large cube. This limits the surface area where ice comes into contact with the contents, reducing the rate of dilution.",
"crushed ice" => "Crushed ice is typically employed in juleps, tiki cocktails, and anything served when it is very hot. The high amount of surface area makes for a frosty drink that is very cold.",
"cracked ice" => "Cracked ice sits somewhere between rocks ice and crushed ice. It is often made by cracking warmed ice with a long spoon or mallet.",
"served hot" => "Since a cocktail is traditionally defined by its use of ice, these drinks are not cocktails by definition, but they are often the perfect choice for chilly evenings.",
"cocktail glass" => "Popular with drinks served up, a cocktail glass includes the popular coupe style as well as a myriad of other small stemmed vessels.",
"collins glass" => "The Collins glass was developed for the classic cocktail family of the same name. Today, this term often refers to a wide gamut of tall vessels perfect for summer drinks that take ice and a straw.",
"rocks glass" => "A rocks glass is wide and squat, perfect for its namesake ice cubes. The rocks glass is also a perfect fit for drinks like the old fashioned, which are built in the glass.",
"tiki glass" => "The tiki glass family varies wildly, from faux-polynesian characters to hurricane glasses. The only rule: make it fun.",
"toddy glass" => "The toddy glass has a handle and thicker sidewalls perfect for hot drinks. We donâ€™t always use a traditional toddy glass, but use it here as a loose symbol for all glassware designed for hot drinks.",
"winter" => "Steaming drinks, creamy cups, and spirit-forward recipes are the defacto standards during the holidays and the icy months that follow.",
"spring" => "Look for early signs of life and shortcuts to thawing out during the spring. Flowers, rhubarb, fresh herbs, and citrus are always a good look.",
"summer" => "The hottest months are the time for tall glasses, crushed ice, and tiki vibes. Look for cooling flavors like mint, citrus, and bubbly.",
"fall" => "The trimming of days and the falling of leaves brings out some of the cocktail world's most adventurous flavors. Opt for big spicy bouquets and spirits made from apples and stone fruit.",
